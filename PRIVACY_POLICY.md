# Privacy Policy
**Last updated: July 30, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how **NoMoreLinks**, our Discord bot, handles data and user privacy. By using the bot, you agree to the practices described below.

## 1. Overview

NoMoreLinks is a privacy-respecting Discord bot. We do **not collect personal data**, and we are committed to transparency in how we handle data for diagnostics and usage analytics.

## 2. What We Collect

We collect **minimal, non-identifying data** strictly for diagnostic and operational purposes.

### A. Diagnostic Logs ("Rays")
- Created **only when errors occur**.
- Contain:
  - The media URL that caused the error
  - A stack trace for debugging
  - A generated **ray ID**
- **Do not include personal data** (no usernames, IDs, IPs, or messages).
- **Deleted automatically after 14 days** or when the bot restarts.

### B. Usage Analytics
To monitor performance and demand, we collect limited metadata:
- Discord **User ID** (internal identifier)
- Discord **Guild ID** (if used in a server)
- **Command name**
- **Timestamp** of the request

This helps us understand usage patterns (e.g., busiest hours, most used features). We do not log command inputs like message content or URLs.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **No personal data or message content** is stored.
- **Error logs (Rays)** are temporary and purged after 14 days.
- **Analytics data** is used only for aggregate insights and performance metrics.
- All logs are stored on the bot’s private server and never shared with third parties.

---

## 4. Tracking and Third-Party Sharing

- We do **not** use cookies, tracking pixels, or fingerprinting.
- We do **not** share logs or analytics with any third parties.
- All data remains within our infrastructure for the sole purpose of improving the bot.
