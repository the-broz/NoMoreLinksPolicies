# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how **NoMoreLinks**, our Discord bot, handles data and user privacy. By using the bot, you agree to the practices described below. To make it clear and simple. **We do not store any information related to you and cannot be pointed back to you. Only generic logging info of errors that occur are stored in a temporary log.**

## 1. Data Collection

**NoMoreLinks** does not collect any personal data (PII) from users. We only collect diagnostic error logs when requests fail, which are used to troubleshoot and improve the bot's performance.

### Error Logs
- We store error logs temporarily in the console of the bot instance.
- These logs are cleared when the bot instance is restarted.
- The logs are strictly used for troubleshooting purposes to ensure the bot's continued functionality.

## 2. Data Storage and Retention

- No personal data or guild information is stored by the bot.
- Diagnostic error logs are kept only until the bot instance is restarted. Once the instance is restarted, these logs are automatically cleared.
- We do not retain any data beyond what is needed for immediate troubleshooting.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share any data collected by the bot with third parties. All logs are stored locally and are only used for the botâ€™s functionality.

## 4. Tracking

No tracking technologies are used by the bot to collect information from users.

## 5. User Rights

Since **NoMoreLinks** does not store personal data, there is no personal information to modify or delete. We do not retain any information that would allow us to identify users individually.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. However, we do not plan to notify users of any changes. By continuing to use the bot, you accept the updated Privacy Policy.
